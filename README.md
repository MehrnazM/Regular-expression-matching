# Regular-expression-matching
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
```bash
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```
***Note***:
<br />
- The pattern should not start with '*' , becaues there is no element before that to match.
-  String and pattern can have any length.
- '*' can match an element more than one time.
